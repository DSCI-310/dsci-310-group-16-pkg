# Code of Conduct

We want to create a safe and inclusive environment where contributors feel welcome and supported. As such, we expect all contributors to collaborate openly and respectfully, regardless of their level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable and will not be tolerated:

The use of sexualized language or imagery
Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
Trolling, bullying, or other forms of harassment
Publishing other people's private information without explicit permission
Other unethical or unprofessional conduct
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor who violates this Code of Conduct or exhibits inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to applying these principles fairly and consistently to every aspect of managing this project. Any maintainer who does not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to a project maintainer at [syamnadhg@hotmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and appropriate action will be taken as deemed necessary.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.3.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/code-of-conduct.html
